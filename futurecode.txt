I want to update the future code to have dynamic reactions. Such as;
an admin page for adding and removing questions.

The current code uses switches. In future I want to change this to an if statement that will allow someone to add and remove a question by checking the condition of which type of question it is.

The current site is complete enough to be used. It is debugged etc.
There is no end page which congratulates the user or shares a final result.
