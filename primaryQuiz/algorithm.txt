The aim;

One question per page
each time the submit button is pressed, the users value is entered and saved
then the window moves to the next question
    : This could be done by stacking the 'cards' containing the questions,
    : And then each time the user submits their answer, it triggers an animation, changing
    : Opacity to 0, hides the card and the next is displayed


Will do 4 radio, 4 checkbox and 2 answer boxes

This will be coded as a mobile view, expanding to desktop

colours;
light blue; #c0dee3
light pink; e5c4d2
light purple; d5afff

DONT encase the button in ahref
it will leave a purple outline on refresh
