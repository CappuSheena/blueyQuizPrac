The aim;

When the user clicks "admin" on the index page, a pop up will open in the middle of the page, and put a grey overlay on the body BEHIND.
It should also have an exit button at the top (use fontAwesome)

to achieve this, mt thinking is;

have a div holding the pop up, with the display set to none. On click, change display to flex(?). On click should also add a blur to the body styles.
